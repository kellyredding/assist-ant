description: Create, change, list, or remove AssistAnt tasks for the user by driving the `assist-ant task` CLI. A task is a named prompt plus a trigger (recurring on an interval or daily time, a one-shot at a time, a manual run-on-demand, or a Today-refresh-glyph task). Use when the user asks to schedule, automate, recur, remind-on-a-cadence, run something on a timer, bind something to a Today refresh, or stop one of these.

# Manage AssistAnt tasks

A task is a **named prompt + a trigger**. When it fires (a later capability),
the prompt is delivered to you in this session and you act on it — so the prompt
is what *you* should later do ("Sync my Linear issues", "Summarize today's
calendar"). You author tasks by running the `assist-ant task` CLI; the app owns
storage and replies with an ack. The Tasks tab only *shows* tasks — there is no
form, so creating and editing always happens here, through you.

Every subcommand needs the app running and returns a one-line result (or a JSON
list). Run `assist-ant task <sub> --help` if unsure of a flag.

## Procedure

1. **Decide the trigger** from how the user phrased the cadence:
   - "every N minutes/hours", "on a timer" → `recurring` + `interval`
     (`--cadence interval --interval-seconds N`).
   - "at 7am", "every morning", "daily at …" → `recurring` + `daily`
     (`--cadence daily --daily-time HH:MM`, resolved to **America/Chicago**).
   - "at 5pm today", a specific date/time, "once" → `one_shot`
     (`--run-at` as full ISO-8601 with offset, e.g. `2026-06-15T17:00:00-05:00`;
     omit to fire on the next tick).
   - "run only when I ask" / on-demand → `manual` (no key; runs from the ▶
     button or the CLI, never on a schedule).
   - "run when I press the Today calendar/to-do refresh" → `today`
     (`--today-key calendar_refresh` for the calendar glyph, `todo_refresh` for
     the to-do glyph). Pressing that Today-sidebar glyph fires **every enabled
     `today` task with that key**, each as its own message — so create as many
     per glyph as the user wants.

   **Refine a recurring cadence** (both optional, both recurring-only):
   - **Weekdays** — "on weekdays", "Mon–Fri", "Tue & Thu" → `--weekdays` as an
     ISO mask, `1`=Mon … `7`=Sun (Mon–Fri = `1,2,3,4,5`; Tue & Thu = `2,4`).
     Applies to `interval` and `daily`. Omit for every day.
   - **Windowed interval** — "every hour at :55 from 8 to 5", "hourly during work
     hours" → `interval` plus `--window-start`/`--window-end` (both `HH:MM`
     local), which anchor the interval inside a daily window. So "every hour at
     :55 from 8 to 5 on weekdays" is **one** task: `--cadence interval
     --interval-seconds 3600 --window-start 08:55 --window-end 16:55 --weekdays
     1,2,3,4,5` — not ten dailies. The window is interval-only.

2. **Compose name + prompt.** A short imperative name ("Linear sync", "Morning
   brief"); the prompt is the instruction you'll later carry out. For a
   multi-line prompt, write it to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/aa-task-<x>.md`) and
   pass `--prompt-file` so newlines survive.

3. **Create** — one call; relay the CLI's one-line ack:

   ```bash
   assist-ant task add \
     --name '<name>' \
     --trigger <recurring|one_shot|manual|today> \
     [--cadence interval --interval-seconds <N>] \
     [--cadence daily --daily-time HH:MM] \
     [--weekdays 1,2,3,4,5] \
     [--window-start HH:MM --window-end HH:MM] \
     [--run-at <ISO8601>] \
     [--today-key calendar_refresh|todo_refresh] \
     [--disabled] \
     --prompt '<prompt>'      # or --prompt-file '<path>'
   ```

4. **Edit.** Run `assist-ant task list` (JSON `{"tasks":[…]}`), fuzzy/semantic-
   match the target by name, then `assist-ant task update <id> --…` with **only
   the changed fields**. Confirm against the ack.

5. **Remove / enable / disable** — `assist-ant task remove|enable|disable <id>`
   after the same list→match step. For a destructive `remove`, confirm which
   task you matched before running it.

6. **Report** terse — the task's name and what you set, in a sentence.

## Notes

- `manual` and `today` tasks fire on demand (the ▶ button, or the matching
  Today refresh glyph for `today`). Scheduled `recurring` / `one_shot` tasks
  don't fire on their own yet — no heartbeat — so say so if the user expects one
  to run on its schedule.
- The CLI validates the trigger/cadence combo and exits non-zero on a bad one
  (e.g. `recurring` with no `--cadence`); the app re-validates and replies
  `{"ok":false,"error":…}` if it still refuses. Surface the error, don't retry
  blindly.
- A missing reply means the app isn't running. It always is while you're in this
  session, so treat "is the app running?" as a real failure to report.
- Run `assist-ant task --help` (or `<sub> --help`) for the current flags rather
  than assuming.
